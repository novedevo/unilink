you'll need to add your own secret_list.py file with contents

```py
client_id = "YOUR CLIENT ID HERE"
client_secret = "YOUR CLIENT SECRET HERE"
```

these are available through the spotify developer portal. if you don't need spotify support, you can set them to anything you'd like. There are similar placeholders in the rust version, although that whole mess panics anyway.
